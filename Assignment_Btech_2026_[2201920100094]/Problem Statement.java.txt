Problem Statement:
Write the following code in your editor below:

1-A class named Arithmetic with a method named add that takes  integers as parameters and returns an integer denoting their sum.
2-A class named Adder that inherits from a superclass named Arithmetic.
Your classes should not be be public.

Input Format:

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin; a locked code stub will test your submission by calling the add method on an Adder object and passing it  integer parameters.
Coding platform used:
"HackerRank".
Approach:
1-create a Base Class (Arithmetic):

This class should have a method add(int a, int b) that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.
2-Create a Subclass (Adder):

The Adder class will inherit from the Arithmetic class.
3-Main Class (Solution):

This is where the test code is written to instantiate the Adder class and use its add method.
Steps to Solve:
1Define the Arithmetic class:
Write a method add(int a, int b) that computes and returns the sum of the two integers.
2-Define the Adder class:
Use the extends keyword to inherit from Arithmetic.
3-Write the Solution class:
Create an object of the Adder class.
