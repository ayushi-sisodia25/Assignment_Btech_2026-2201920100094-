Problem statement:
--A class defines a blueprint for an object. We use the same syntax to declare objects of a class as we use to declare variables of other basic types. For example:

Box box1;          // Declares variable box1 of type Box
Box box2;          // Declare variable box2 of type Box
Kristen is a contender for valedictorian of her high school. She wants to know how many students (if any) have scored higher than her in the  exams given during this semester.

Create a class named  Students with the following specifications:

--An instance variable named scores to hold a student's  exam scores.
--A void input() function that reads 5 integers and saves them to scores .
--An int calculateTotalScore() function that returns the sum of the student's scores.
Input Format
--Most of the input is handled for you by the locked code in the editor.
In the void Student::input() function, you must read 5 scores from stdin and save them to your score instance variable.

Output Format
--In the int Student::calculateTotalScore() function, you must return the student's total grade (the sum of the values score in ).
--The locked code in the editor will determine how many scores are larger than Kristen's and print that number to the console.

Platform Used:
--HackerRank

Approach:
Step 1: Understanding the Problem
Each student has 5 test scores.
We need to:
--Read and store the scores.
--Compute the total score for each student.
Step 2: Implementing the Solution
1.Create a Student class with:
--A private array scores[5] to store the scores.
--A public method input() to read 5 scores.
--A public method calculateTotalScore() to compute and return the total score.

2.Read input:
--First, take an integer N (number of students).
--Create an array/vector of Student objects.
--Use the input() method to store scores.

3.Calculate and Compare Scores:
--Compute the total score for the first student (Kristen in the problem).
--Compare Kristenâ€™s score with the rest of the students.
--Count how many students scored higher.
