Problem Statement:
In this challenge, you are required to compute the area of a rectangle using classes.

Create two classes:

Rectangle

The Rectangle class should have two data fields-width and height of int types. The class should have display() method, to print the width and height of the rectangle separated by space.

RectangleArea

The RectangleArea class is derived from Rectangle class, i.e., it is the sub-class of Rectangle class. The class should have read_input() method, to read the values of width and height of the rectangle. The RectangleArea class should also overload the display() method to print the area  (width*height) of the rectangle.

Input Format

The first and only line of input contains two space separated integers denoting the width and height of the rectangle.

HackerRank

Approach:
1. Understanding the Classes:
--Base Class (Rectangle)
-Contains two integer members: width and height.
-Has a virtual display() method to print width and height.
--Derived Class (RectangleArea)
Inherits from Rectangle.
-Contains a read_input() function to take user input.
-Overrides the display() function to print the area instead of dimensions.
2. Steps to Implement the Solution:
Step 1: Define the Base Class (Rectangle)
Step 2: Define the Derived Class (RectangleArea)
3. Create the Main Function
-Create an object of RectangleArea.
